# image-processing
This Python script employs OpenCV for image processing, applying X-Sobel and Y-Sobel edge detection, accentuating image edges. Additionally, it utilizes the Canny edge detection method to comprehensively highlight edges. The results are showcased through matplotlib, offering a concise and effective representation of the image's edge-enhanced .
